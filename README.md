# UnivariateAnomalydetection

 WaRTEm-AD 
 
 WaRTEM-AD directory has main code of Twin auto ecoder architecture, Warp operators and representation extraction
 This code can be executed easily using code_wartem.ipynb python notebook
 Menton the parammeters as input arguments along with python run command
 Also these parameters can be mentioned in dict_to_yaml.py
 
 Anomaly scoring after representation learning can be done with point/seq_anomaly scoring.ipynb
